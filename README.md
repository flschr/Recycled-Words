# Recycled Words
This is my personal blog running on [Yellow CMS](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow). Changes are automatically published with the help of [FTP Deploy Action](https://github.com/SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action). Pictures are automatically shrinked to 1280x960 and compressed with [Tinify](https://github.com/namoscato/action-tinify) which relies on [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/). All edits are done in [Atom](https://atom.io/) (on my desktop) and [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) (on my mobile).
