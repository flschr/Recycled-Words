# Recycled Words
This is my personal blog running on [Yellow CMS](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow). Changes are automatically published with the help of [FTP Deploy Action](https://github.com/SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action). Pictures are automatically optimized with [Imgbot](https://imgbot.net/). All edits are done in [Atom](https://atom.io/) (on my desktop) and [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) (on my mobile).

Visit [my blog](https://gaehn.org), or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/flschr), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/flschr) or [Komoot](https://www.komoot.de/user/848543125284). Or anywhere else.

#### How it works
Short description how blogging works (more will follow later)

#### Updating Yellow CMS
This repository exists out of 2 branches: "main" is my live system and "stage" is my test environment (f.e for updates of Yellow). (more will follow later)
