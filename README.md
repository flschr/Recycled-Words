# Recycled Words
This is my personal blog running on [Yellow CMS](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow). Changes are automatically published with the help of [FTP Deploy Action](https://github.com/SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action). Pictures are automatically optimized with [Imgbot](https://imgbot.net/). All edits are done in [Atom](https://atom.io/) (on my desktop) and [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) (on my mobile).

In this repository are 2 branches: "main" is the live system and "stage" is for running tests (f.e updates of Yellow) on my stage environment.
