# Recycled Words
This is my personal blog running on [Yellow CMS](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow). Changes are automatically published with the help of [FTP Deploy Action](https://github.com/SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action). Pictures are automatically optimized with [Imgbot](https://imgbot.net/). I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) (on my desktop) and [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) (on my mobile) for edits.

Visit [my blog](https://gaehn.org), and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/flschr), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/flschr) and [Komoot](https://www.komoot.de/user/848543125284).

## How it works
This repository exists out of 2 permanent branches. ```main``` is my [live system](https://gaehn.org) while ```stage``` is my [little playground](https://test.gaehn.org) for testing more extensive modifications before publishing them to my website (f.e. test Yellow updates and new plugins but also design and layout customizations). All commits are automatically published by [FTP Deploy Action](https://github.com/SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action) to the corresponding ```main``` and ```stage``` directory on my web server.

### How blogging works
For creating new content I always use the ```main``` branch. Usually I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) on my desktop to write new articles and make other edits. If, for whatever reason, I need to write a article on the go, I'll use [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) as my preferred editor.

#### Handling of pictures
As I use my iPhone for taking photos only, I'll need a smart way to push pictures into my repository. For that I've created this [Siri shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2b41352b03fb469e954fac53165a8268) which runs photos from the iOS share sheet through the following workflow:

- Resize picture to ```1280px*auto-height```
- Convert picture to JPEG (can't make use of HEIC)
- Reduce image quality to ~90%
- Write picture to ```/media/images/yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.jpeg``` within Working Copy
- For ease of use, append the ready to use markup ```[image yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.jpeg]``` to ```/content/1-blog/_latest-pics.txt```
- Commit changes
- Optional: automatic fetch, pull and push repository within Working Copy

The pictures can than to be used in blog articles within Atom and Working Copy. A few moments later, all pictures are automatically optimized by [Imgbot](https://imgbot.net/) to further reduce the file size with a lossless compression.

### Updating Yellow CMS
The disadvantage by using a Github repository as powerhouse for content creation, website management and deployment of a website running on Yellow is, that you can't use the [standard procedures](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/tree/master/source/update) for updating Yellow CMS to a new version. But anyway, as Yellow only consists out of a a few ```PHP``` and ```HTML``` files, it is not that hard to perform a manual update. When you customized Yellow to your own needs, its even easier to use the tools provided by Atom and Github to migrate your customizations to a new version of Yellow.

#### Steps to update Yellow CMS
Follow this guide for a manual update of Yellow CMS. Depending on the level of your own customizations, you'll probably need 5-10 minutes to update Yellow CMS.

1. Download the [latest Yellow release](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/archive/master.zip) and unzip it to a local ```$temp-directory```.
2. Unzip ```blog.php``` from ```$temp-dir\system\extensions\install-blog.zip``` to ```$temp-dir\system\extensions```.
3. Unzip ```german.php```, ```german.txt```, ```english.php```, ```english.txt``` from ```$temp-dir\system\extensions\install-languages.zip``` to ```$temp-dir\system\extensions```.
4. As I don't need the edit extension at all, I delete all ```edit.*``` files and  ```yellow-user.ini``` from ```$temp-dir\system\extensions```. You also can safely delete all ```*.zip``` files from this directory.
5. Open Atom and switch to your ```stage``` branch.
6. Drag & drop all files from ```$temp-dir\system\extensions``` to the Yellow extension directory in your Atom project. Atom will automatically highlight all files orange that include changes from the repository. All even files, won't be highlighted and you can ignore them.
7. For migrating ```yellow-system.ini``` I suggest to make a diff against the ```main``` repository to see if the updated file contains any new settings. If there are no new settings, I discard all changes of this file.
8. Drag and drop ```$temp-dir\yellow.php``` and all files from ```$temp-dir\system\layouts``` to your Atom project. As I customized nearly every layout file, I diff the local copy against the ```main``` branch to spot the differences in detail. If there are no necessary changes, I discard the changes.
9. Push all changes to your remote repository and wait a few seconds for the automatic sync with your web server. Check your [stage environment](https://test.gaehn.org) and if your website is still running fine merge the ```beta``` and ```main``` branch. Thats it!

#### Updating Yellow CMS extensions
Updating Yellow extensions works the same way as updating Yellow. Simply download and unzip the extension you want to update. Drag and drop all necessary files in the corresponding folders of your Atom project and proceed like described above.
