# Recycled Words
This is my personal blog running on [Yellow CMS](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow). Changes are automatically published with the help of [FTP Deploy Action](https://github.com/SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action). Pictures are automatically optimized with [Imgbot](https://imgbot.net/).

Visit [my blog](https://gaehn.org), and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/flschr), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/flschr) and [Komoot](https://www.komoot.de/user/848543125284).

## How it works
This repository exists out of 2 permanent branches. ```main``` is my [live system](https://gaehn.org) while ```stage``` is my [little playground](https://test.gaehn.org) for testing more extensive modifications before publishing them to my website (f.e. test Yellow updates and new plugins but also design and layout customizations). All commits are automatically published by [FTP Deploy Action](https://github.com/SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action) to the corresponding ```main``` and ```stage``` directory on my web server.

### How blogging works
For creating new content I always use the ```main``` branch. Usually I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) on my desktop to write new articles and make other edits. If, for whatever reason, I need to write a article on the go, I'll use [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) as my preferred editor.

#### Handling of pictures
As I use my iPhone for taking photos only, I'll need a smart way to push pictures into my repository. For that I've created this [Siri shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2b41352b03fb469e954fac53165a8268) which runs photos from the iOS share sheet through the following workflow:

- Resize picture to ```1280px*auto-height```
- Convert picture to JPEG (can't make use of HEIC)
- Reduce image quality to ~90%
- Write picture to ```/media/images/yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.jpeg``` within Working Copy
- For ease of use, append the ready to use markup ```[image yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.jpeg]``` to ```/content/1-blog/_latest-pics.txt```
- Commit changes
- Choice for automatic fetch, pull and push repository within Working Copy


The pictures can than to be used in blog articles within Atom and Working Copy. A few moments later, all pictures are automatically optimized by [Imgbot](https://imgbot.net/) to further reduce the file size with a lossless compression.
